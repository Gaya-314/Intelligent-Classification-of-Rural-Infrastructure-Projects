Intelligent Classification of Rural Infrastructure Projects (PMGSY)
This project uses machine learning to automatically classify Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) road and bridge projects into their respective schemes such as PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, PMGSY-III, RCPLWEA, and PM-JANMAN.
The model analyzes physical and financial features of each project and predicts the correct scheme to improve transparency, monitoring, and resource planning.
